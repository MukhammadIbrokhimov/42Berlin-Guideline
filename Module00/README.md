# C++ Module 00 - Readme

## Description

This repository contains the exercises for **C++ Module 00**, which introduces fundamental concepts of C++ programming. The module focuses on **namespaces**, **classes**, **member functions**, **stdio streams**, **initialization lists**, **static**, **const**, and other basic C++ features. The goal is to help you transition from C to C++ and get familiar with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

The exercises are designed to progressively increase in complexity, starting with simple tasks and moving towards more advanced concepts. You will implement classes, manage memory, and work with C++ standard libraries while adhering to the **C++98 standard**.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 00: Megaphone

- **Description**: Write a program that takes input from the command line and outputs it in uppercase. If no input is provided, the program should output a loud noise message.
- **Files to submit**: `Makefile`, `megaphone.cpp`
- **Forbidden functions**: None
- **Objective**: Get familiar with basic C++ syntax, command-line arguments, and string manipulation.

### Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook

- **Description**: Implement a simple phonebook application that allows users to add, search, and display contacts. The phonebook can store up to 8 contacts, and if a 9th contact is added, the oldest one is replaced.
- **Files to submit**: `Makefile`, `*.cpp`, `*.{h, hpp}`
- **Forbidden functions**: None
- **Objective**: Practice class design, encapsulation, and basic user input/output handling.

### Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams

- **Description**: Recreate a missing `Account.cpp` file based on a provided `Account.hpp` header and a log file. The goal is to match the behavior described in the log file.
- **Files to submit**: `Makefile`, `Account.cpp`, `Account.hpp`, `tests.cpp`
- **Forbidden functions**: None
- **Objective**: Understand class implementation, constructors, destructors, and logging mechanisms.
